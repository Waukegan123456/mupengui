1. Get qt development package.

To build on ubuntu install qt using http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/

2. Build

$ cd mupengui-0.1/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make

3. Development

Use qt creator to open mupengui.pro file and write code. If you add visual elements copy *.h and *.cpp from your build directory to  mupengui-0.1/ directory and add the corresponding .cpp file to CMakeLists.txt

4. About qmake in mupengui-0.1 directory
You could easily build the project from command line using "qmake ." and make in mupengui-0.1 directory, but I recommend against it. If you however do that, don't run make clean, because it removes ui design files (our corresponding files *.cpp and *.h) from above. If you run "make clean" make sure you copy those files back.

5. Building for debian
If you run build.sh or install.sh it will build corresponding deb file. Make sure to set DEBFULLNAME and DEBEMAIL environment variables. If key error occurs, it does not affect the build.


Cheers!!
